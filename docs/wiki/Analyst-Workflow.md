# Your first investigation

Start with a question: “Have we seen this observable?” or “Does this exploited vulnerability apply to our software?” The dashboard provides evidence and working sets; your own telemetry and asset inventory determine the next action.

## Observable investigation

1. **Check freshness.** Look at the published snapshot and source health before treating results as current.
2. **Look up the value.** Ordinary and defanged forms are supported. Preserve the full URL path/query when checking a URL.
3. **Inspect evidence.** Read sources, timestamps, tags, context and score. Check the original report where appropriate; do not navigate directly to a suspicious indicator.
4. **Explore relationships.** Use the graph and discovery desk to form a hypothesis. A shared source or tag is a lead, not attribution.
5. **Build a working set.** Add relevant records to the investigation queue. Row menus keep copy, SPL and other actions compact; adding to the queue remains prominent.
6. **Open Workspace.** Use the persistent shortcut instead of scrolling through the whole page. Keyboard users have an early navigation path too. Back to results returns to the earlier position.
7. **Hunt or export.** Configure the live workspace SPL for your index, time range and field names. Copy/download the query, or export selected evidence in an appropriate format.
8. **Validate in your environment.** Correlate with assets, user activity and expected traffic before escalation or enforcement.

## Choose the next tool from the evidence

| Starting question | Next move |
| --- | --- |
| “What does this IOC connect to?” | Inspect its provider/source evidence and the bounded graph, then check related values against your own telemetry. |
| “Is this CVE relevant to our software?” | Open the CVE detail, follow an exact product if useful, and compare an on-demand inventory report. The [CVE guide](https://github.com/PKHarsimran/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector/wiki/CVE-and-Exposure) explains uncertainty and the Today patch scenario. |
| “Which group was reported with this record?” | Open [Groups](https://harsim.ca/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector/groups.html) for association receipts and changes. A feed match is not independent confirmation. |
| “How could we investigate this group?” | Open the [Ransomware Workbench](https://harsim.ca/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector/ransomware-workbench.html) for exact triage, coverage, comparison, and draft response packs. Choose a focus group deliberately; rankings are review order, not attribution. |

The main page, Groups, and Workbench read published snapshots. They do not query ransomware.live or your SIEM on each click. See [How it works](https://github.com/PKHarsimran/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector/wiki/How-It-Works) for the producer/consumer boundary.

## Resume and recover

The queue holds up to **50 indicators**. Export JSON to keep a portable investigation copy. “Resume a saved investigation” imports up to **500 KB**, merges with the queue, preserves existing evidence for duplicates and rejects invalid/over-capacity input without partially changing the queue.

Undo restores one prior queue change, including ordering and generated SPL. It is held in page memory and disappears on reload. Duplicate-only imports do not consume a meaningful undo step. If saving to browser storage fails, the UI offers a retry; export before leaving.

## What is saved where

| State | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Investigation queue | Browser local storage when available; no account/device synchronization. |
| Undo and workspace SPL configuration | Current page memory. |
| Quick row-SPL index preference | Browser local storage when available. |
| Product watches and review state | Browser local storage when available. |
| Imported asset inventory | Current tab memory; not uploaded or saved to local storage. |

The distinction between quick row-SPL and workspace SPL settings reflects the current implementation. Read [SPL and integrations](https://github.com/PKHarsimran/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector/wiki/SPL-and-Integrations) before using either query.

## When the record is a CVE

A CVE-only queue shows a software-verification checklist rather than workspace IOC SPL. Use **Review evidence** to open the exact CVE across statuses, then compare vendor/product/version evidence. Mixed queues generate workspace SPL only for supported observables and disclose exclusions.

## Share evidence, not certainty

Exported files contain the working set you selected. Shared filter links can expose search terms; inspect them before sharing. Clearing browser storage can remove your saved queue/watches. A feed-refresh failure must not leave an enabled export of stale removed rows. If the UI reports unavailable evidence, resolve freshness before relying on a result.
