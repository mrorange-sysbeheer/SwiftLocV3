# Architecture and execution flow

SwiftIOC has two runtimes connected by published files: a scheduled Python producer and a browser consumer. Static hosting distributes the output. Analysts' queue and inventory state are managed in the browser.

  L --> M[Static hosting]
  M --> N[Browser dashboard]
  M --> O[External security tools]
  R[Permitted ransomware.live PRO access] --> S[Cached derived group and aggregate sidecars]

```

This diagram shows the publication boundary: source quality checks occur before sensitive-record filtering, persistence and retention. Therefore, source ingestion counts can be larger than final exported counts. A quality-pass result does not guarantee that all later disk writes or deployment succeeded.

## Code map

| `parsers.py` / `extract.py` | Provider adapters and extraction into common records. |
| `models.py` / `fp.py` | Identity, normalization, classification and false-positive rules. |
| `scoring.py` | Relevance explanation, baseline loading, persistence, decay, retention. |
| `quality.py` / `publication.py` | Required-source checks and targeted sensitive-data filtering. |
| `writers.py` / `collections.py` | Formats, separate observable/CVE collections, Delta, atomic file writes. |
| `detections.py` / `verify_detections.py` | Detection compilation and offline artifact consistency verification. |
| `ransomware_live.py` / `ransomware_context.py` / `group_history.py` | Optional, cached provider enrichment; group association history and privacy-minimized aggregate context. |
| `public/assets/dashboard-core.js` | Pure browser data logic, graph model, searches, workspace transformations. |
| `public/assets/dashboard.js` | DOM, fetching, controls, rendering, local workspace state. |
| `public/assets/inventory-core.js` / `inventory.js` | Applicability comparison and exposure-report UI. |
| `public/assets/today-core.js` / `today.js` | Personalized review suggestions and hypothetical patch scenarios over published snapshots. |
| `public/assets/group-intel*`, `groups.js`, `ransomware-workbench*` | Static group evidence, receipts, comparisons, coverage and response-draft interfaces. |

## One record's lifecycle

Suppose two sources report the same IP. Their parsers emit records with source names and timestamps. Normalization gives both the same `(type, indicator)` identity. Deduplication merges their provenance. Persistence can recover an earlier first-seen date and increment sightings. Scoring ranks its current relevance. Retention determines whether it is published. The dashboard then exposes evidence and lets an analyst add it to a hunt.

An older carried-forward record is copied before rescoring. Otherwise, mutating the current record would also mutate the previous baseline and hide score changes in Delta.

## Failure boundaries

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Collector
  participant U as Upstream feeds
  participant Q as Quality checks
  participant F as Published files
  C->>U: Fetch configured sources
  U-->>C: Records and possible source failures
  C->>Q: Counts, source timestamps, prior counts
  alt Required check rejects attempt
    Q-->>C: Rejection reasons
    C->>F: Write separate collection-attempt.json only
  else Checks pass
    Q-->>C: Accepted quality phase
    C->>C: Filter, merge, score and retain
    C->>F: Replace individual output files
  end
```

Writers use temporary files and replacement so a reader does not see a half-written individual file. **The whole directory is not one transaction.** A disk error between files can leave different generations. Current baseline validation checks usable row counts against diagnostics; it is not a cryptographic identity check. Immutable generation directories with a single manifest switch are a useful future improvement.
