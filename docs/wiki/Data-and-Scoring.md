# Identity, relevance and change

## Shared record model

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `indicator`, `type` | Observable or CVE value and classification; together form identity. |
| `source` | Comma-separated source identifiers retained through merging. |
| `first_seen`, `last_seen` | Evidence timestamps used for history and age; interpretation depends on the adapter. |
| `confidence`, `score` | Source-assigned confidence and calculated relevance ranking. |
| `tlp`, `tags`, `reference`, `context` | Handling label and supporting context. Respect provider terms too. |
| `sightings` | Accumulated collector observations; not the number of attacks or affected hosts. |
| `vulnerability` | Structured provider reports, such as CISA KEV and NVD evidence. |

Different CVE IDs stay separate. The same CVE can combine multiple provider reports. URL scheme/host normalization must preserve case-sensitive path and query components: `/Payload` and `/payload` may be different resources. Defanging changes display spelling (`hxxps`, `[.]`); refanging restores forms used for matching.

## Explain the score

```text
base = 40 (low), 60 (medium), 80 (high); unrecognized confidence uses 50
bonus = min(8 × additional reporting groups, 16)
score = clamp(round((base + bonus) × 0.5 ^ (age_hours / half_life_hours)), 0, 100)
```

Age comes from `last_seen`, with negative age clamped to zero. Missing/unparseable dates fall back to the scoring time. That fallback is not evidence of a fresh attack; preserve real timestamps in adapters.

| Type | Half-life |
| --- | --- |
| IP address, URL | 7 days |
| Domain; unlisted type default | 14 days |
| CIDR, JA3/JA3S, email | 30 days |
| Bitcoin address | 90 days |
| File hashes | 180 days |
| CVE | 365 days |

![Two illustrative curves start at 88; IP and URL relevance halves every seven days, domain relevance every fourteen days.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PKHarsimran/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector/76421f9f4d7a5e007ec2990debf715cd3eefebe3/docs/wiki/assets/score-decay.png)

Example: a high-confidence IP from two distinct reporting groups starts at 88, becomes 44 after seven days without a newer sighting, then 22 after fourteen. This is a transparent ranking heuristic, **not a calibrated probability**. Shipped aliases from one publisher, such as URLhaus and ThreatFox, count once; aggregate IPsum and the Tor exit directory add no reporting-group bonus. Unmapped custom feeds retain distinct source-name identities until their provenance is reviewed. Even two mapped publishers do not prove independent observations.

## Persistence and retention

With `--persist-feed`, re-observed records inherit history while prior-only records are copied forward and age. Scores below `--min-score` (default 20) expire. Optional `--max-age-days` and `--max-store` bound the result; both are off by default in the CLI. The production workflow enables 30 days and 10,000 records.

When capacity is exceeded, non-rejected KEV records whose catalog evidence was checked within 24 hours receive priority, newest KEV additions first. Remaining priority uses score, source count and stable recency tie-breaks. Age/score expiry happens before the cap, so KEV prioritization does not imply a complete KEV catalog.

The high-confidence subset requires at least one reporting group and includes score ≥80 by default **or** at least two reporting groups. Multi-group older records may therefore enter it below 80. It is a review set, not a guarantee of safe blocking. Dashboard samples expose the raw feed names and the collector's score factors expose reporting groups and excluded aggregate/context sources.

## SOC Delta

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P[Validated previous snapshot] --> C[Compare identities and material evidence]
  N[Current retained snapshot] --> C
  C --> A[Added]
  C --> U[Updated]
  C --> R[Removed from feed]
  M[Missing or invalid baseline] --> B[Establish baseline with no historical alert flood]
```

Delta schema version 1 contains generation timestamps, `baseline_available`, counts and events. Updates cover source, confidence, tags, material provider evidence and score changes of at least five points or a score-band crossing. Routine polling timestamps do not create evidence updates. `removed_from_feed` means absence from the retained snapshot, not “benign.”

The baseline requires a usable previous JSONL snapshot whose loaded record count agrees with previous diagnostics. Missing/corrupt data must not turn every current record into a false “new” alert. Loaded baselines remain immutable during rescoring so genuine decay updates and removal payloads preserve their prior values.
