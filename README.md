SwiftIOC is an open-source Python threat intelligence automation toolkit that
keeps recent Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in machine-readable formats. The
lightweight collector (`swiftioc/`) ingests threat feeds via YAML
configuration, normalises and deduplicates the indicators, and exports them to
CSV, TSV, JSON, JSON Lines, STIX 2.1, TAXII 2.1, and MISP alongside searchable
run diagnostics and a compact change stream for continuous ingestion.

Designed for security operations teams, SOC analysts, and cyber threat hunters,
SwiftIOC runs anywhere Python is available—local workstations, CI/CD pipelines,
GitHub Actions, or automated cron jobs. Outputs land under `public/` by default
so they can be published directly with GitHub Pages, integrated into SIEM and
SOAR tooling, or archived for compliance reporting. The repository includes
ready-to-use examples for rapid deployment in modern DevSecOps workflows.

### Vulnerabilities and observables are separate collections

SwiftIOC deduplicates by `(type, indicator)`: `CVE-2020-1234` and
`CVE-2020-5678` stay separate even if both appear in NVD or share a generic
`cve` tag. Reports about **the same CVE** are combined under that CVE ID while
keeping `reports.cisa_kev` and `reports.nvd` separately. The site opens on
**Known exploited**, showing only confirmed KEV entries, newest additions first.
It never fills an empty watchlist with unconfirmed CVEs. **Ransomware evidence**
requires CISA's explicit `Known` ransomware-use value; `Unknown` does not qualify.
**All CVEs · prioritized** includes exploitation reports and other CVEs, newest
NVD publications first within each group. The JSON export uses that full priority ordering, with
rejected records last. CVE ID year and generic IOC scores do not establish recency.

Use **Added to KEV · 30 days**, **Published · 7 days**, or **Updated · 7 days**
to focus on recent catalog additions, disclosures, or provider record edits.
These are different events: an old CVE added to KEV today belongs in the first
view, and an old CVE edited today belongs in the third, not the newly published
view. Date windows use UTC provider timestamps and exclude unknown, invalid,
and future dates. Search and exploitation filters apply within each view.

NVD rejected records are hidden by default, with a count and an opt-in control;
they remain in exports for auditability. Cards expose provider dates and CISA
actions. A snapshot older than 24 hours is flagged, and old or missing KEV check
dates are labeled as historical evidence. Neither a fresh snapshot nor KEV
membership proves attacks are happening now. These are triage priorities;
match affected products to your assets before deciding remediation. The campaign graph and
Discovery desk use observables; CVEs have their own searchable, paginated view.

Each collector run writes these additive exports:

| Collection | Contents | Intended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`collections/vulnerabilities.json`](https://harsim.ca/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector/collections/vulnerabilities.json) | Versioned document with `generated_at`, coverage scope, counts, and `items`, one per CVE. | Vulnerability triage and patch investigations. |
| [`collections/observables.jsonl`](https://harsim.ca/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector/collections/observables.jsonl) | All retained non-CVE records, using the existing indicator schema. | IOC integrations that need CVEs excluded; apply your own score/type policy. |

The vulnerability export uses three exploitation labels:

- `known_exploited`: structured evidence from the CISA KEV adapter. The
  [CISA catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
  records vulnerabilities known to have been exploited. A catalog entry does
  not say an attack is happening now or that your own assets are affected.
- `reported_exploitation`: a source or legacy feed supplied an
  `exploited-in-the-wild` tag, without structured KEV evidence in this record.
- `not_established`: this retained record does not establish exploitation.
  It does **not** mean the vulnerability has never been exploited. NVD severity
  and SwiftIOC relevance scores alone never promote this label.

CISA reports preserve vendor, product, description, required action, catalog
addition date, directive due date, ransomware-use value, and catalog check
time. NVD reports preserve description, publication/modification dates,
status, and available severity. These dates describe provider records, not
attack times. CISA due dates concern its directive; they are not universal
patch deadlines. Review NVD status, including rejected records, before triage.

Both collections cover the **retained feed**, not the entire KEV or NVD
catalogs. Source windows, per-source caps, request failures, expiry, and
retention limits can reduce coverage. With `--persist-feed`, a missing provider
report is retained with its original dates; a fresh report from that provider
replaces its previous fields. Check the provider dates and run diagnostics
before treating evidence as fresh. Collection generation time is not a source
observation time.

No migration or new CLI flag is required. `iocs/latest.*` and high-confidence
outputs remain combined feeds for compatibility; their JSON records now carry
an additive `vulnerability` object (empty for observables). CSV columns remain
unchanged. Existing snapshots load with an empty object and gain structured
reports on the next successful source fetch. The new collection files are
regenerated during publishing; a static checkout needs a collector run to
populate them.

### Pick the right feed

| Feed | Use it when | Operational note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `high_confidence.csv` | A human needs a small, block-ready spreadsheet or import file. | Review against local allowlists and policy before enforcement. |
| `high_confidence.jsonl` | A machine ingests strong indicators one record at a time. | Includes score, sources, timestamps, tags, and context. |
| `latest.jsonl` | You need the complete current SwiftIOC snapshot. | Larger download; use for initial sync and recovery. |
| `delta.jsonl` | You poll SwiftIOC every collection cycle. | Idempotently apply `added`/`updated`; remove `removed_from_feed` from the working set. |
| `stix2.json` / `taxii2-envelope.json` | Your CTI tooling understands STIX or TAXII objects. | Objects are built together so their versions remain identical. |
| `feed.xml` | A person wants high-confidence additions in an RSS reader. | Best for awareness; use JSONL for automation. |

> [!CAUTION]
> Threat intelligence is evidence for triage, not an automatic verdict. Apply
> local allowlists, asset context, and response policy before blocking. A
> `removed_from_feed` event means SwiftIOC no longer publishes that IOC; it does
> not prove the indicator became benign. Indicators are defanged in human-facing
> views to reduce accidental activation.

## 🔍 SwiftIOC at a glance
SwiftIOC helps cybersecurity teams automate the collection and publication of
high-fidelity IOCs from authoritative sources. The project emphasises:

- **Automated threat feed aggregation** with YAML-based configuration.
- **Consistent IOC enrichment** ready for SIEM, SOAR, IDS, and DFIR tooling.
- **Git-friendly artefacts** tailored for GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions, and
  other CI/CD environments.

## 🚀 Features
- **Discovery desk** – switch between corroborated reports, sightings from the last 24 hours, and uncommon tags in the filtered preview. Each lead explains its selection, opens source evidence, and can be saved to the investigation queue. Export a JSON evidence brief with the reasons attached. Sample rarity is explicitly distinguished from global rarity.
- **Analyst-first live dashboard** – search raw or defanged IOCs, combine
  multi-select type/source/tag/score/age filters, inspect score rationale, and
  shortlist findings in a private investigation queue that persists in the
  browser. Queue contents can be copied or exported as CSV/JSON without being
  sent to a server. The interface includes responsive threat visualisations and
  motion that automatically disables when reduced motion is requested.
- **YAML-driven feeds** – feed metadata lives in `sources.yml` so collections can
  be changed without touching Python code. The example file includes adapters for
  CISA KEV, NVD, URLhaus, MalwareBazaar, ThreatFox, Feodo Tracker, SSLBL JA3,
  Spamhaus DROP, DShield/SANS ISC, OpenPhish, CINS Army, Tor exit lists, and more.
- **Indicator normalisation** – every indicator is represented by the
  `Indicator` dataclass and classified (IPv4/IPv6, URL, domain, hash, CVE, etc.)
  before being written to disk. 
- **Defanging & deduplication** – helper functions defang URLs/domains and
  remove duplicate indicators so that downstream tools receive safe, unique
  values. Host casing is normalised before dedup so `Evil.COM` and `evil.com`
  collapse to one record.
- **False-positive filtering** – bogon IP ranges (private, loopback,
  link-local, reserved, multicast) and well-known benign hosts (`example.com`,
  `localhost`, `*.test`, …) are dropped automatically; disable with
  `--no-fp-filter`. The count is reported in diagnostics.
- **Indicator scoring, decay & a living feed** – every indicator gets a 0–100
  relevance score combining source confidence, cross-source corroboration
  (independent feeds agreeing boosts the score), and age-based exponential
  decay with per-type half-lives. With `--persist-feed` the collector merges
  the previously published feed each run: re-observed indicators refresh to
  full score, unobserved ones fade out, and entries below `--min-score`
  expire. Most free aggregators publish stale snapshots — SwiftIOC publishes
  a self-maintaining feed.
- **Curated high-confidence feed** – alongside the full exports, every run emits
  `high_confidence.csv`/`.jsonl` containing only indicators that score ≥80 or
  are confirmed by 2+ independent sources, strongest-first. This is the
  block-ready subset for SIEM/firewall ingestion where false positives are
  costly.
- **SOC Delta stream** – `delta.json` and `delta.jsonl` describe additions,
  material changes, and removals since the last validated snapshot. Consumers
  can poll a small change feed during normal operation and reserve the complete
  snapshot for initial sync or recovery.
- **Interoperable and verifiable delivery** – the same in-memory STIX objects
  are published as a STIX 2.1 bundle and static TAXII 2.1 envelope. An optional
  keyless Sigstore workflow signs canonical feeds, and
  [`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md) provides starter guidance
  for Splunk, Elastic Security, and Microsoft Sentinel.
- **Deployment-ready container** – the included image runs as an unprivileged
  user, persists output through `/data`, and exposes the collector self-test as
  its health check.
- **Retention / "top IOCs" curation** – `--max-age-days` drops indicators not
  seen recently and `--max-store` prioritizes recently checked KEV entries, then fills the remaining slots by score and recency, so
  the published feed stays small, fresh, and high-signal (think *KEV catalogue,
  but for indicators*) instead of an unbounded dump. The scheduled workflow
  curates to the last 30 days and the top 10,000 indicators.
- **MISP feed** – every run writes a MISP-compatible feed (`public/misp/` —
  `manifest.json` + one event) that any MISP instance can subscribe to
  directly (Sync Actions → Feeds → add by URL), no API key needed on either
  side. The event UUID is stable across runs, so it updates in place instead
  of accumulating a new event forever.
- **RSS feed & status badge** – `public/feed.xml` lets people subscribe to the
  newest high-confidence indicators instead of polling the dashboard.
  `public/badge.json` is a shields.io endpoint badge showing live indicator
  count — see the `IOCs` badge at the top of this README.
- **Trend history & IOC lookup** – the dashboard renders a sparkline of feed
  size over the last ~90 runs (`diagnostics/history.json`) and a search box to
  check whether a specific IP/domain/URL/hash is currently in the feed
  (instant against the top feed, falls back to a one-time full-feed scan if
  not found there).
- **IOC time machine** – because every run commits `latest.jsonl`, the git
  history is an append-only archive of *what was publicly known-bad at time T,
  at what score, confirmed by which sources*.
  [`scripts/build_history_index.py`](scripts/build_history_index.py) turns that
  history into a SQLite index + a compact `history_summary.json`, and
  [`scripts/ioc_timeline.py`](scripts/ioc_timeline.py) answers the forensic
  question commercial platforms charge for — *"was this indicator known-bad on
  the day we saw it, and how confidently?"* — from free, auditable public data:

  ```bash
  python scripts/build_history_index.py --out-dir public --since-days 180
  python scripts/ioc_timeline.py 45.137.21.9
  python scripts/ioc_timeline.py --at 2026-03-01 evil.example.com
  ```

  Both scripts take a few more flags than shown above — run either with
  `--help`, or see: `build_history_index.py` also accepts `--max-commits`
  (cap the number of feed commits walked) and `--summary-max` (cap
  `history_summary.json` to the N most-attested indicators); `ioc_timeline.py`
  also accepts `--db` (point at a different index file) and `--json` (emit
  the raw record instead of the human-readable summary).
- **Sightings** – each indicator tracks how many collection runs have
  re-observed it (`sightings`), so a one-off scanner hit is distinguishable
  from an IP flagged across dozens of runs. Surfaced in the exports and the
  dashboard lookup dossier.
- **Concurrent collection** – sources are fetched in parallel (configurable via
  `--max-workers`), so a full run completes in a fraction of the time of a
  sequential fetch without changing the deterministic output.
- **Multiple export formats** – each run emits CSV, TSV, JSON, JSON Lines, a
  STIX 2.1 bundle, and a Markdown changelog. The STIX bundle covers every
  indicator type (IPs and CIDRs, domains, URLs, all hash sizes, emails, JA3/JA3S,
  wallets) with deterministic RFC 4122 UUIDs, a producer `identity`, and a TLP
  marking, so re-imports stay idempotent in MISP, OpenCTI, and similar platforms.
  CVEs are emitted as `vulnerability` objects. The changelog is capped to the
  most recent runs to keep it committable indefinitely.
- **Rich diagnostics** – a JSON run summary, Markdown report, and per-source
  counts are generated automatically for audits and dashboards. 
- **Optional RSS collection** – RSS feeds are processed when `feedparser` is
  installed; use `--skip-rss` (or `--ci-safe`) to run without the dependency.
- **CI-friendly defaults** – JSON logging, deterministic output paths, and
  guard-rail flags (`--fail-on-empty`, `--fail-if-stale`, `--grace-on-404`) make
  the collector predictable in automation.

## 🛡️ GitHub project health
- **Continuous integration** – the `CI – SwiftIOC` workflow lint-checks the
  Python codebase, validates types, audits dependencies, and exercises the
  collector end-to-end on every push and pull request.
- **CodeQL scanning** – GitHub's CodeQL workflow analyses the repository for
  common security issues to keep the collector safe for automation.
- **Security policy** – coordinated vulnerability disclosures are handled via
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) with direct contact guidance for maintainers.

## 🌐 Supported threat intelligence sources
SwiftIOC ships with parsers and adapters for widely referenced cyber threat
intelligence feeds used by SOC teams and managed security providers:

- **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** – prioritise patching by
  monitoring the official CISA KEV catalogue.
- **NVD (NIST National Vulnerability Database)** – recently published/updated
  CVEs with CVSS severity, corroborating and enriching the KEV catalogue.
- **URLhaus** – ingest malicious URL indicators to protect web gateways and
  proxies.
- **MalwareBazaar** – track malicious file hashes for EDR, AV, and sandbox
  tooling.
- **ThreatFox** – add IPs, domains, URLs, and hashes curated by abuse.ch.
- **Feodo Tracker & SSLBL JA3 fingerprints** – detect C2 traffic associated
  with banking trojans and malicious TLS fingerprints.
- **Spamhaus DROP/EDROP** – block known botnet controllers at the network edge.
- **DShield / SANS Internet Storm Center** – the top attacking netblocks from
  DShield's independent, distributed sensor network — a genuinely different
  detection methodology from the abuse.ch/CINS/IPsum feeds above, so overlap
  with them is real cross-vendor corroboration, not double-counting.
- **OpenPhish, CINS Army, Tor exit lists, blocklist.de, IPsum, and more** –
  extend coverage with phishing, scanning, and anonymiser indicators.

Each feed is configurable through `sources.yml`, allowing teams to fine-tune the
collection cadence, lookback windows, and authentication as required.

## 🎯 Use cases & SEO-friendly keywords
SwiftIOC supports a wide range of cybersecurity automation workflows. Common
use cases include:

- **Security Operations Centre (SOC) automation** – schedule IOC collection
  jobs to keep SIEM and IDS rules current with open-source threat intelligence.
- **Digital forensics & incident response (DFIR)** – export defanged indicators
  for investigations without risking accidental activation.
- **DevSecOps pipelines** – integrate threat feed enrichment into CI/CD, GitOps,
  or infrastructure-as-code projects.
- **Threat hunting playbooks** – generate STIX 2.1 bundles consumable by MISP,
  OpenCTI, and other CTI platforms.
- **Compliance reporting and executive dashboards** – leverage Markdown and
  JSON diagnostics for stakeholder-friendly reporting.

Keywords to improve discoverability: "automated threat intelligence collector",
"open source IOC feed aggregator", "Python threat hunting toolkit", "cyber
threat intelligence automation", "STIX export for SOC", and "GitHub Actions

## 🧠 How it works
1. **Load configuration** – `swiftioc` reads `sources.yml` (falling back to
   `sources.example.yml` when needed) and sets up logging, user agents, and
   output directories. 
2. **Collect per source** – each API or RSS source is routed to a parser
   registered via `@register_parser`, which fetches and converts raw feed data
   into `Indicator` objects. Sources are fetched concurrently.
3. **Deduplicate & filter** – indicators are normalised, merged, deduplicated,
   filtered for false positives, and bounded by the configured lookback window.
4. **Score & age** – each indicator receives a 0–100 score; with
   `--persist-feed` the previous feed is merged in and stale entries expire.
5. **Publish outputs** – all formats, diagnostics, and changelog entries are
   written beneath the chosen output directory. 

## 📈 Indicator scoring & the living feed
Every published indicator carries a `score` (0–100) computed as:

```
score = (confidence base + corroboration bonus) × 0.5^(age / half-life)
```

- **Confidence base** – `high` = 80, `medium` = 60, `low` = 40 (assigned by the
  source adapter).
- **Corroboration bonus** – +8 per additional independent source reporting the
  same indicator, capped at +16. An IP flagged by Feodo Tracker *and* ThreatFox
  *and* a vendor blog outranks a single scanner hit.
- **Age decay** – exponential on hours since `last_seen`, with per-type
  half-lives that mirror how quickly each indicator class goes stale: URLs and
  IPs decay in about a week (phishing pages die fast; C2 IPs get reassigned),
  domains in two, curated CIDR blocks and JA3 fingerprints in a month, file
  hashes over six months, and CVEs over a year.

When a storage cap is set, non-rejected CVEs with a KEV catalog check in the
past 24 hours take priority over generic IOC scores, with newest KEV additions
first. Stale, missing, or future check dates receive no special retention
priority. Score expiry and maximum-age rules still apply, and the cap remains
strict; if qualifying KEV records alone exceed it, older additions are pruned.
Source failures and per-source limits can still restrict upstream coverage.

With `--persist-feed` (enabled in the scheduled collection workflow) the
previous `latest.jsonl` is merged into each run, making the published feed
**stateful**: re-observed indicators refresh to full score with their original
`first_seen` and accumulated source history preserved, indicators that stop
appearing decay run over run, and anything whose score falls below
`--min-score` (default 20) is expired from the feed. The same score is emitted
as the STIX 2.1 `confidence` property, so downstream platforms can prioritise
on it directly.

## 🏁 Quick start
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.10 or newer (tested with CPython on Linux and GitHub Actions)
- `pip` for dependency management

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/PKHarsimran/SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector.git
cd SwiftIOC-Automated-Threat-Intelligence-Collector

# 2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows PowerShell

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the collector with the sample sources
python -m swiftioc --sources sources.example.yml --out-dir public
```

Artifacts appear under `public/`. Add `--verbose` for progress logging or
`--self-test` to run the built-in sanity checks without touching the network.

> **Installing as a package:** `pip install .` (or `pip install -e .` for
> development) also registers a `swiftioc` console script, so `swiftioc
> --sources sources.example.yml --out-dir public` works identically to
> `python -m swiftioc ...` without the `-m` invocation.

### Container quick start

The included image runs as an unprivileged user and stores generated output in
`/data`:

```bash
docker build -t swiftioc .
docker volume create swiftioc-data
docker run --rm \
  -v swiftioc-data:/data \
  swiftioc
```

The default container command uses `sources.example.yml`, persists the living
feed, retains the strongest 10,000 indicators from the last 30 days, and runs a
built-in health check. Mount your own source configuration when needed:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/sources.yml:/app/sources.yml:ro" \
  -v swiftioc-data:/data \
  swiftioc
```

For starter mappings and polling guidance for Splunk, Elastic Security, and
Microsoft Sentinel, see [`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md).


## 🧾 Configuring sources
Create a `sources.yml` to describe the feeds you care about. The file mirrors the
structure in `sources.example.yml` and supports per-source options. `window_hours`
defines the global lookback window; override it for individual feeds using
`--source-window name=HOURS` on the CLI. 

```yaml
window_hours: 48

Each parser can accept additional keyword arguments defined under `options:`.
Custom parsers are supported via Python dotted paths (for example,
`parse: my_package.parsers:parse_feed`).

For feeds without a dedicated adapter you can fall back to the universal
collector by setting `parse: universal`. It will autodetect JSON, CSV, or plain
text payloads, discover common timestamp/tag fields, and extract indicators via
the same heuristics used for RSS content.

## 📋 CLI reference
Run `python -m swiftioc --help` for the full list of switches. Highlights:

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--out-dir PATH` | Directory where artifacts are written (`public/` by default). |
| `--sources PATH` | YAML configuration (`sources.yml`, falls back to `sources.example.yml`). |
| `--window-hours N` | Global lookback window in hours. |
| `--skip-rss` | Disable RSS processing entirely. |
| `--max-per-source N` | Cap the number of indicators taken from each source. |
| `--max-workers N` | Number of sources fetched concurrently (default `8`; use `1` to disable threading). |
| `--no-fp-filter` | Disable bogon / false-positive filtering (keep private IPs, `example.com`, etc.). |
| `--persist-feed` | Living feed: merge the previously published `latest.jsonl`, decay scores by age, expire stale entries. |
| `--min-score N` | Expire indicators whose decayed score falls below `N` (default `20`). |
| `--high-confidence-score N` | Score at/above which an indicator enters the curated `high_confidence` feed (default `80`; multi-source indicators always qualify). |
| `--max-age-days N` | Retention: drop indicators whose `last_seen` is older than `N` days. |
| `--max-store N` | Retention: keep at most `N`; non-rejected KEV entries checked within 24 hours take priority (newest catalog additions first), then other records by score/recency. |
| `--dashboard-rows N` | Rows in the compact `dashboard.jsonl` the web dashboard downloads (default `1000`, ~2–3% of the full feed's size). |
| `--site-url URL` | Public site URL used as the RSS `<link>` (override for forks/custom domains). |
| `--rss-limit N` | Number of items in `feed.xml` (default `50`). |
| `--no-misp-feed` | Disable writing the MISP feed directory. |
| `--urlhaus-status {any,online,offline}` | Filter URLhaus indicators by status. |
| `--source-window name=N` | Override the lookback window for specific sources. |
| `--grace-on-404 name…` | Treat HTTP 404 for listed sources as a non-fatal empty result. |
| `--fail-on-empty name…` | Fail the run if any listed sources return zero indicators. |
| `--fail-if-stale name=N` | Fail when the newest indicator from `name` is older than `N` hours. |
| `--warn-if-volume-drop name=N` | Warn when a source returns at least `N` percent fewer rows than the prior run. |
| `--save-raw-dir PATH` | Persist raw feed responses for later inspection. |
| `--diag-json PATH` | Write diagnostics JSON (defaults to `<out-dir>/diagnostics/run.json`). |
| `--report PATH` | Write Markdown run report (defaults to `<out-dir>/diagnostics/REPORT.md`). |
| `--ua-file PATH` | Provide a custom user-agent pool (one UA per line). |
| `--ci-safe` | Convenience flag for CI runs (JSON logs, ensures diagnostics dirs, tolerates missing RSS dependency). |
| `--self-test` | Execute built-in assertions without fetching feeds. |
| `-v/--verbose` | Increase console logging (`-vv` for debug). |
| `--log-file PATH` | Send logs to a file. |
| `--log-format {text,json}` | Choose console/file log format. |
| `--log-file-level LEVEL` | Control the file log level (default `DEBUG`). |

## 📦 Outputs & diagnostics

Every run also publishes `iocs/delta.json` and `iocs/delta.jsonl`. These SOC
Delta feeds describe indicators added to the published snapshot, removed from
it, or materially changed since the previous run. A removal means the IOC is no
longer in the current SwiftIOC snapshot; it does not assert that the IOC is
benign. The first run emits an empty delta until a baseline exists.
Changes to vulnerability provider reports (including severity, status, required
actions, and due dates) emit `updated` events with `changes.vulnerability` and
the complete current record. A change only to CISA's local
`catalog_checked_at` poll timestamp does not trigger an alert. Provider report
additions and removals do trigger updates.

The collector populates the following structure (paths relative to `--out-dir`):

```
public/
├── index.md
├── feed.xml                   # RSS: newest high-confidence indicators
├── badge.json                 # shields.io endpoint badge (live IOC count)
├── iocs/
│   ├── latest.csv
│   ├── latest.tsv
│   ├── latest.json
│   ├── latest.jsonl
│   ├── delta.json              # SOC Delta envelope + counts
│   ├── delta.jsonl             # stream-friendly change events
│   ├── taxii2-envelope.json    # TAXII 2.1 envelope containing STIX objects
│   ├── high_confidence.csv    # curated: score ≥80 or 2+ sources
│   ├── high_confidence.jsonl  # same, machine-readable
│   ├── dashboard.jsonl        # compact top-N feed the web dashboard loads
│   └── stix2.json
├── misp/
│   ├── manifest.json          # MISP feed manifest (add by URL in MISP)
│   └── <event-uuid>.json      # single stable event, updated in place
├── changelog/
│   └── CHANGELOG.md
└── diagnostics/
    ├── REPORT.md
    ├── run.json
    ├── summary.md
    ├── history.json           # rolling per-run stats (dashboard sparkline)
    └── raw/                 # present when --save-raw-dir is used
```

The diagnostics include per-source counts, duplicate statistics, earliest and
latest timestamps, and any recorded failures. These summaries are useful for CI
status checks and dashboards.

## 🌍 GitHub Pages preview & publishing
SwiftIOC ships with a Pages-ready dashboard so the collected indicators can be
browsed without additional tooling. The project uses `public/` as both the
artifact directory and the published site root:

- `public/index.html` renders the live preview, source breakdowns, tag counts,
  and export links using the JSON/JSONL outputs produced by `swiftioc`.
- `index.html` at the repository root provides a branded landing page that
  redirects to `public/` after a short delay while offering quick links for
  manual navigation.

To publish on GitHub Pages:

1. Run the collector locally or in CI to populate `public/` (see
   [Quick start](#-quick-start)).
2. Commit the generated artifacts or upload them as a workflow artifact (as
   shown in [Running in GitHub Actions](#-running-in-github-actions)).
3. Enable GitHub Pages with the **GitHub Actions** source so deployments pick up
   the latest `public/` output automatically.

The dashboard ranks preview rows by the collector's 0–100 relevance score
(corroboration + freshness baked in), then by how many independent sources
confirm each indicator, so the most dangerous and most corroborated IOCs sit at
the top of the feed. Multi-select facets combine type, source, tag, score band,
and age filters; a signal filter isolates high-score (≥80), corroborated (2+
sources), or new (last 48h) indicators. Analysts can add table or lookup results
to a private browser-local investigation queue and export that shortlist without
uploading it anywhere.

The interface includes an animated feed radar, progressive metrics, score-band
motion, and responsive threat cards. Animations use transform/opacity paths and
are disabled when the browser reports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Mobile
breakpoints convert the preview into card-style rows, collapsed details remain
hidden until requested, and human-facing IOC metadata stays defanged to reduce
accidental activation.

## ⚙️ Running in GitHub Actions
SwiftIOC runs cleanly inside GitHub Actions and emits artifacts that can be
published via GitHub Pages. The minimal workflow below collects IOCs every 4
hours and deploys `public/` — it's a stripped-down starting point; it does
**not** persist the feed across runs (see the callout below the code block).
For the full production setup — including the living feed, retention, MISP
feed, RSS, and auto-committing outputs back to the repo — see the actual
[`.github/workflows/collect.yml`](.github/workflows/collect.yml) this project
runs on itself.

```yaml
name: SwiftIOC – Threat Intel Collector

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 */4 * * *"   # Run every 4 hours
  workflow_dispatch:         # Allow manual runs from the Actions tab

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Collect recent IOCs
        run: python -m swiftioc --ci-safe --window-hours 48 --out-dir public

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./public

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

`--ci-safe` enables JSON logging, ensures diagnostic directories exist, and
suppresses hard failures when the optional RSS dependency is missing.

> **This example is stateless.** Each run starts from an empty feed and
> publishes only what it collects in `--window-hours 48` — it does not get
> the self-maintaining "living feed" or "top IOCs" curation described in
> [Indicator scoring & the living feed](#-indicator-scoring--the-living-feed).
> To get that, checkout with `fetch-depth: 0`, add `--persist-feed
> --max-age-days 30 --max-store 10000` to the collector invocation, and
> auto-commit `public/` back to the repo before deploying — exactly what
> `.github/workflows/collect.yml` does.


## 🧪 Auto-generated IOC summary
The helper script [`scripts/summarize_iocs.py`](scripts/summarize_iocs.py)
turns the diagnostics and JSONL output into Markdown summaries. It runs
automatically in the "Collect – SwiftIOC" workflow and can also be executed
manually:

```bash
python scripts/summarize_iocs.py \
  --diag public/diagnostics/run.json \
  --ioc-jsonl public/iocs/latest.jsonl
```

Override `--out` or `--index` to control where the summary is written. When the
repository is published with GitHub Pages, everything under `public/` becomes the
site content.

## 🧑‍💻 Development & testing
Contributions are welcome. Set up a development environment and run the same
checks CI runs:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

ruff check .          # lint
pyright               # static type check
python -m swiftioc --self-test   # built-in sanity assertions
pytest -q             # offline unit tests (parsers, STIX, dedup, changelog)
node --test public/assets/dashboard-core.test.js  # frontend data logic
```

The `tests/` suite is fully offline—parsers that would hit the network have
their HTTP layer monkeypatched—so it is safe to run anywhere and catches feed
format drift before it reaches production. When `stix2` is installed the suite
also validates the generated bundle against the reference library.

For the vulnerability view’s browser regression checks, install Playwright
in your development environment (`npm install --no-save --package-lock=false
playwright`, then `npx playwright install chromium`). Serve `public/` with
`python -m http.server 8765 --directory public` and, in a second terminal, run
`node scripts/test_vulnerability_ui.cjs`. The test injects synthetic CVE data
and covers filtering, pagination, safe rendering, mobile overflow, refresh
failure, retry, and empty collections. Set `BASE_URL` for another local port or
`PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to use an existing Chromium browser.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to add a new feed parser and the
full contribution workflow.
